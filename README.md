# Switch Tracker
Checks the /r/nintendoswitch subreddit for new posts flagged with 'NA' (north america) flair and sends the user a notification of new posts.

I added a new relic dependency as a quick way to setup something to ping my heroku server since it's on the free dyno and wants to sleep sometimes.

I'm only going to text myself, so if you want texts you need to deploy your own instance, but you can see the last thing I found at https://switch-finder.herokuapp.com/ .
