# Switch Tracker
Checks the /r/nintendoswitch subreddit for new posts flagged with 'NA' (north america) flair and sends the user a notification of new posts.

I'm only going to text myself, so if you want texts you need to deploy your own instance, but you can see the last thing I found at https://switch-finder.herokuapp.com/ .
